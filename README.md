# TLOU-Death-Screen-Effect
![Cool Preview (BSMOD kick animation by Pixelbozz)](https://github.com/CT-Studios-UT/TLOU-Death-Screen-Effect/blob/main/workshopassets/widescreenpreview.gif)

This repository aims to re-upload and enhance the original TLOU death screen for Garry's Mod, since it was deleted off of the workshop.

This wouldn't have been possible without **u/GateCages** archiving the original mod's code!

New features since the original upload of the mod:

- Alternate death sounds (WIP)

## Installing

*Steam workshop upload soon*

## Usage

There's not much to using the mod except for just loading it up and well... Dying!  But there are some ConVars you can mess with in the console.

| ConVar | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tloudeath_blockouttime` | 0.9 | Time before screen blacks out after death |
| `tloudeath_deathsound` | 1 | Play death sound? |
| `tloudeath_postprocess` | 1 | Enable post processing effects? |
| `tloudeath_dsp` | 1 | Enable sound DSP ("underwater" effect on all sounds) on blackout? |
| `tloudeath_altsound` (WIP) | 0 | Enable alternate sound by U/GateCages? (Be sure to set `tloudeath_deathsound 0` when having this set to 1, unless you like them being layered.) |
